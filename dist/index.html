      <h1>Grilled Cheese Truck</h1>
      <p>Our food truck does one thing and does that thing well. 
        We make the best grilled cheese sandwiches around. We only 
        use bread, butter, and cheese. Any other ingredients makes 
        the sandwich a melt which we definitely do not do. Do ask 
        for meat or avocado or anything else. We only serve grilled cheese!</p>
